This script was written to solve Exercise #4 of the Pragmatic Programmer. Utilizes the turtle graphics python library to draw shapes on the display. Uses a parser to understand an external command language defined by the author, and translate that into commands to draw graphics. 

To run, simply cd into the directory and run 'python turtleExample.py'. To change commands, edit the 'input.txt' file. To change how command abbreviations map to methods of the turtle graphics library, edit the 'commands.json' file.
